# class-exchange
A website created for SpartaHack V to help teacher-to-student and student-to-student communication and collaboration. It combines the global support feature similar to Stack Exchange to allow students to ask questions to students around the world at all times of day, and the local classroom communication provided by sites such as Google Classroom or Moodle.

⚠️ This is a Hackathon entry for SpartaHack V, and was created in under 36 hours. The code in this repo is likely to be hacky and potentially unstable/insecure, so please be careful if forking this repo.
